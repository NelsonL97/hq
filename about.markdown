Lambda Genetics is a Washington, D.C. based cannabis research laboratory specializing in tissue culture,
cloning, and chemotypical profiling via HPLC standard technique. 

Our lab specializes in identifying medically valuable strains by identifying the key cannabinoids and terpenes in samples, both of which are compounds known for their combative abilities against many common symptoms of illnesses.
